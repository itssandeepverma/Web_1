            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various
                researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of
                the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural
                heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big ">Some researchers, like R. S. Peters, have proposed precise definitions by spelling out the necessary and sufficient conditions of education, for example: (1) it is concerned with the transmission of knowledge and understanding; (2) this transmission
                is worthwhile and (3) done in a morally appropriate manner in tune with the student's interests.[11][12][3] This and similar attempts are often successful at characterizing the most paradigmatic forms of education but have received numerous
                criticisms nonetheless, usually in the form of specific counterexamples for which the proposed criteria fail.[12][13][4] These difficulties have led various theorists to develop less precise conceptions based on family resemblance. This
                means that all the different forms of education are similar to each other even though they need not share an essential set of features characteristic of all of them.[3][14][15] This view can also be combined with the idea that the meaning
                of the term "education" is context-dependent and may thus vary depending on the situation in which it is used.[4] Having a clear idea of what the term means is important for various issues: it is needed to identify and coherently talk
                about it as well as to determine how to achieve and measure it</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small ">Your future is in your Hand</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big ">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists belonging to diverse fields.[3][4][5] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[6] But
                they often include other aims as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[6][3][7] However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions,
                it is primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[8][9][4] Others understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. On this view, education is what
                educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of them.[8][9][4] However, the term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as
                well as the social institutions involved in these processes.[9] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the Latin word ēducātiō ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which is related to
                the homonym ēdūcō ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ē- ("from, out of") and dūcō ("I lead, I conduct")
